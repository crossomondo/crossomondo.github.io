<h2>JORDAN</h2>
<body>
<p class="solid">When travelling around Jordan, the diversity of landscapes and people may surprise you. Experience the serene and humble lifestyle of the Bedouins in the desert of Wadi Rum by camping with them for a night, but don't forget to explore what the fast city life in Amman has to offer as well.

Once you enter Jordan, you'll get to see an aspect of Middle-East that you wouldn't have expected. The country is home to very friendly and hospitable people who warmly welcome tourists.</p>
