 <h2>FRANCE</h2>
<body>
<p class="solid">Paris is undoubtedly one of the most fascinating and beautiful cities on earth. With glamorous buildings, chic cafés and more galleries than you could ever visit, Paris will captivate your heart and soul. Make sure you divide your time between being the ultimate tourist and climbing to the top of the Eiffel Tower. Head out to one of the city’s many bars and grab yourself a Pastis to sip with the Parisians for an authentic taste of life in the capital. When I went to paris, my family and I stayed in the country side for a few days and the country side is beautiful, calm, peaceful, and allows you to have a whole other outlook of France.</p>
