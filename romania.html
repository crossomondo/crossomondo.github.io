 <h2>ROMANIA</h2>
<body>
<p class="solid">Due to its varied landscape, Romania is the most biogeographically diverse country in the European Union. With snow-capped mountains, green hills covered in forests and vineyards, sandy Black Sea beaches and Europe's largest and best-preserved delta, Romania has something for everyone. I lived in Romania for two years, and traveled around the whole country. The countryside and life away from the city is breathtaking. Romania is a place to visit, and never forget!</p>
